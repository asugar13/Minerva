  browser extension, command-line app, etc.?      
   * When describing the problem/need, give concrete examples of common use cases.
* Focus on *what* your product does, and avoid discussing *how* you're going to implement it.      
  For example: This is not the time or the place to talk about which programming language and/or framework you are planning to use.

#### Q2: Who are your target users?

YOUR ANSWER GOES HERE ...

* Short (1 - 2 min' read max)
* Be specific (e.g. )
* Feel free (but not obligated) to use personas.        
  You can create your personas as part of this Markdown file, or add a link to an external site (for example, [Xtensio](https://xtensio.com/user-persona/)).

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

* Our yearly-time table generator will benefit many students to plan their academic years easy, and quick.
* What puts us in a unique place compare to other products(Griddy.org or semester.ly)?
  * Our product saves users time greatly due to our two factors: managing yearly schedule, and automatic generator with filter options.
  * We as a team saw the problem existed in Griddy.org like developers of semester.ly, but we also noticed a limitation in semester.ly's functionality.  Because our product can automatically generate both semesters' timetable at the same time, we believe that our product will function at least twice more efficient than other products out there. 
  * We also realize that some users prefer "specific style" of time table, thus our filter option will be able to assist them better than ever.
  * In summary, our users will be able to plan their academic year more efficiently as our product generates optional, conflict-free, customized, yearly time table automatically.
