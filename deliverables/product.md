# Timetable Generator/ Team 22

#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

We are planning to build a desktop app to allow UofT students to choose their academic schedules more efficiently and to their preferences.
The program will allow students to input the courses that they wish to be enrolled in and an algorithm generates all the possible timetable
combinations. Then, the student can find his most suitable schedule by filtering based on some criteria such as number of days off or time
in between lectures.

A few mock-ups of our UI:

#### Q2: Who are your target users?

Our scheduling app is for those that are in need of a fast, efficient and easy-to-use tool for scheduling courses.  This includes
students that are heavily involved with extracurriculars, daily commuters, full/part-time workers and other types of people that require
a specialized time-table that won't conflict with their outside schedules. It is also targeted towards any student that has certain
preferences for their timetables and wants to create the best timetable given their courses.  New users that, for the first time, are
creating their own course schedules at UofT and are overwhelmed by the amount of choice in courses can also find some use from this app. 
This app will serve as a smooth and easy transition from secondary school to university by providing automatic choices of yearly time-tables
for them.

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

* Our yearly-time table generator will provide services to many students to plan their academic years easily and quickly.

* **What puts us in a unique place compare to other products(Griddy.org or semester.ly)?**
  * Our product saves users time due to the two factors: managing a "yearly" schedule, and an automatic generator with filter options.
  * We as a team saw that a problem existed in Griddy.org like developers of semester.ly, but we also noticed a limitation in semester.ly's
  functionality.  Our product can automatically generate "both" semesters' timetable at the same time, so we believe that our product
  will function at least twice as efficiently as other products out there.
  * We also realized that some users prefer a "specific style" of time table, thus our filter option will be able to assist them better than
  ever.
  * In summary, our users will be able to plan their academic year more efficiently as our product generates optional, conflict-free,
  customized, yearly time table automatically.

### Highlights

* We were not clear on exactly what we were building. There was some confusion as to whether we would be doing a mobile app, desktop app or
website. It was determined that a mobile app was not the correct platform as screen real estate was too small. We tentatively finalized on a
desktop app as that would be what we are most comfortable with.
* A few team members brought up similar scheduling websites, mainly semester.ly. It is very similar to our idea. We now know that we need to
include more specific filtering option than semester.ly.
* For project boards we considered Jira, Kyber and Trello. We settled on Trello as it was lightweight, free and easy to use.
