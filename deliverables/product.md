#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

* Our yearly-time table generator will provide services to many students to plan their academic years easy, and quick.
* What puts us in a unique place compare to other products(Griddy.org or semester.ly)?
  * Our product saves users time greatly due to the two factors: managing "yearly" schedule, and automatic generator with filter options.
  * We as a team saw the problem existed in Griddy.org like developers of semester.ly, but we also noticed a limitation in semester.ly's functionality.  Because our product can automatically generate "both" semesters' timetable at the same time, we believe that our product will function at least twice more efficient than other products out there. 
  * We also realized that some users prefer "specific style" of time table, thus our filter option will be able to assist them better than ever.
  * In summary, our users will be able to plan their academic year more efficiently as our product generates optional, conflict-free, customized, yearly time table automatically.
