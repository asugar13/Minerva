We are planning to build a desktop app to allow (UofT) students to choose their academic schedules more efficiently.
The student inputs the courses that he wishes to be enrolled in and an algorithm generates all the possible timetable combinations.
Then, the student can find his most suitable schedule by filtering based on some criteria such as number of days off or time in between lectures.


#### Q2: Who are your target users?

Our scheduling app is for those that are in need of a fast, efficient and easy-to-use tool for scheduling courses.  This includes
students that are heavily involved with extracurriculars, daily commuters, full/part-time workers and more types of people that require
a specialized time-table that won't conflict with their outside schedules.  It is targeted at users that, for the first time, are creating
their own course schedules at UofT and are overwhlemed by the amount of choice in courses.  This app will serve as a smooth and easy
transition from secondary school to University by providing automatic choices of yearly time-tables for them.

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

* Our yearly-time table generator will provide services to many students to plan their academic years easy, and quick.

* **What puts us in a unique place compare to other products(Griddy.org or semester.ly)?**
  * Our product saves users time greatly due to the two factors: managing "yearly" schedule, and automatic generator with filter options.
  * We as a team saw the problem existed in Griddy.org like developers of semester.ly, but we also noticed a limitation in semester.ly's functionality.  Because our product can automatically generate "both" semesters' timetable at the same time, we believe that our product will function at least twice more efficient than other products out there.
  * We also realized that some users prefer "specific style" of time table, thus our filter option will be able to assist them better than ever.
  * In summary, our users will be able to plan their academic year more efficiently as our product generates optional, conflict-free, customized, yearly time table automatically.
