# Timetable Generator/Team 22

## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: March 9, 2017 2:00
 * Where: BA2185

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

* Trello
 * The board has been really helpful in making sure that everyone knows what they are doing, what everyone else is doing and 
  avoiding conflicts.

* Slack
 * It's a good communication channel.
 * We've been able to sort out issues and discuss design decisions.

* Github Workflow
 * There have been very few major conflicts. 
 * This is working very well with Trello.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

* Meeting frequency
 * We only planned to have weekly sync meetings.
 * We've found that we probably need to meet more often and code together in person.
 * While Slack does work well, it would be much easier to keep everyone on the same page if we meet in person to discuss code.
* Roles
 * We've found that we might need to have a few more roles. 
 * It would be nice to have a front end manager or code reviewer. Having more defined roles would make decision making a bit easier.


#### Planned changes

* Have coding meetings.
 * As seen above, it would make design decisions easier to make.
* Add a front end manager.
 * We want to designate a front end manager.
 * Giving someone the authority to make decisions speeds up the decision making process because someone will have final say.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

* Define API for making requests to the back end and define API for sending data to front end
 * https://github.com/csc301-winter-2017/project-team-22/tree/master/httpObjectExamples
* Write Data Access Object (DAO) class
 * https://github.com/csc301-winter-2017/project-team-22/tree/master/TimetableGen/src/dao 
 * Still needs to be tested
* Write Business Object 
 * https://github.com/csc301-winter-2017/project-team-22/tree/master/TimetableGen/src/businessobject
 * Still needs to me tested
* Convert mocks-ups to HTML/Javascript.
 * https://github.com/csc301-winter-2017/project-team-22/tree/master/webApp

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

* Write Generator class
 * We have not gotten to this yet. 
* Write HTTP request class
 * We have not gotten to this yet.
* Link front end HTML/Javascript to backend Java API
 * This was not a high priority. This was important to iteration 3, but a reach goal for iteration 2. 

## Meeting Highlights

* We need more focused user personas.
 * Based on TA feedback, we should narrow down our target users.
* We need to decide on better filtering criteria, and figure out where filtering is happening.
 * We've found that we're actually not sure if filtering is a back-end or front-end responsibility.
* We need to finish the HTTP server and the generator.
* We should probably put some more effort into the front end design and colour palettes.
