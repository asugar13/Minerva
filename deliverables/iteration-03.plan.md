# Minerva/Group 22


## Iteration 3

 * Start date: March 14, 2017
 * End date: March 23, 2017

## Process

#### Changes from previous iteration

List the most significant changes you made to your process (if any).

* We will have more in person meetings.
  * It's easier to hash out smaller details and keep everyone on the same page if we actually talk in person and can draw diagrams 
  or physically point out pieces of code. 
* We will add a front end manager.
  * Giving someone the power to make final decisions makes overall decision making easier.
* Put due dates on Trello tickets.
  * This will hopefully motivate people to finish tasks sooner.
  * We will try to record when a task was actually done versus its due date, to measure our productivity.

#### Events

* We will have weekly sync meetings during tutorials 
  * We will discuss:
    * What we’ve done
    * What we’re going to do/What needs to be done
    * Any problems or issues we’re facing
 
* We will have weekly coding meetings.
  * We will code together in person and clear up any questions that have come up.  

#### Artifacts

* We will set up a task board on Trello to keep track of what needs to be done and any issues that come up.
  * We will start to put due dates on Trello tasks.
* Tasks will be prioritized based on the order they listed in. High priority goes to the top of the list and team members can rearrange tasks as they see fit.
* Team members take whatever tasks they are most comfortable with and move them to the assigned/working on list.

* Trello is integrated with Slack to provide notifications for updates to the board
* We will use Slack to communicate throughout the week when we run into issues
* If issues come up then process can vary slightly, for example if one feature is blocking somebody’s, then they can for somebody to pick up that ticket or to pick it up themselves and finish it asap.

#### Git / GitHub workflow

This is identical to iteration-02.plan.md. (https://github.com/csc301-winter-2017/project-team-22/blob/master/deliverables/iteration-02.plan.md)

 * Every team member will fork the master repo.
 * After someone finishes a feature, they can make a pull request from their fork to the master repo.
   * If the team member is confident they can merge the request themselves. They may also request a code review and have another team member
 merge the request.
 * Conflicts should be resolved by whoever is making the merge.

We hope that this workflow will minimize conflicts while allowing for code reviews if necessary. We trust team members to be able make good decisions about what code gets merged into the master repo and whether or not they need help.
