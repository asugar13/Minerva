## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

* When: FILL IN THE DATE WHEN YOU ACTUALLY HAD YOUR REVIEW MEETING
Thursday, February 9, 2017
* Where: PHYSICAL LOCATION AND/OR ONLINE

## Process - Reflection

(Optional) Short introduction

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

* 2 - 4 decisions.

1. Decision to use trello. This decision was successful because it provided us with a fast and easy platform to organize and coordinate
our efforts. Specifically, it allowed us to know which tasks are unfinished, who is working on any given task and notifies the rest of
the group when a certain task is finished. 
https://trello.com (Currently invite only)

2. Decision to use slack. This decision was successful because it provided real time updates on the trello page, quick updates on team
members, focus boards for certain aspects of the project. Slack, being a desktop, browser and mobile makes it immensely convenient for
portability.

3.Decision to use Discord. This decision was successful because it provided a platform to organize an online meeting by using voice
channels.
