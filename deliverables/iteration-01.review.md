# Timetable Generator/Team 22

## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

When: Thursday, February 9, 2017. 1-2 pm.

Where: Bahen Center. 40 St. George St, Toronto ON, M5S 2E4. Room 2185.

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

1. Decision to use Trello. This decision was successful because it provided us with a fast and easy platform to organize and coordinate
our efforts. Specifically, it allowed us to know which tasks are unfinished, who is working on any given task and notifies the rest of
the group when a certain task is finished.

2. Decision to use Slack. This decision was successful because it provided real time updates on the Trello page, quick updates on team
members, and focus boards for certain aspects of the project. Slack, being a desktop, browser and mobile app makes it immensely convenient 
for portability.

3. Decision to use Discord. This decision was successful because it provided a platform to organize an online meeting by using voice
channels.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped
         
1. We were unable to decide on which front end to implement for our application. We are not sure which interface suits our application the most. At the present moment, we are debating a choice between a desktop application and a web application. 

2. Another decision that did not work out as planned was our choice to use video conferencing to conduct our first planning meeting. Some of us were not able to connect to the call, and for those of us who did connect to the call, we got disconnected within the first minute. Here is a screenshot of our conversation that happened concurrently.

#### Planned changes

* We decided to opt out of the mobile application option from our front-end possibilities as users preferred using a desktop for scheduling courses.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

* Get everybody on Slack and Trello - was not part of original plan but was essential in organizing our team

* product.md (In repository)
* Iteration-01.plan.md (In repository)

* Fill in Trello board with tasks.

* Finish at least 1 story and commit. (Refer to above image)

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

* The high level architecture description and external API description are not completed as of yet. We decided to push that off to the next iteration. They are important for coding which is something that we didn't need to do this iteration.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

1. We figured out that we need to concretely define an API so that the backend and the frontend can be worked on simultaneously, however the API should be defined in a way that is unrelated to the front end interface. We can then change the front end interface without worrying about messing up the API.

2. We need to decide on tools, frameworks, and languages to be used. We need to find what the team is comfortable with and works with our needs.

3. We need to plan and design the architecture of the product and decide how to delegate the tasks. If everybody turns out to be comfortable  with the whole system then tasks can be delegated at will, otherwise higher level parts and roles should be defined and assigned.
