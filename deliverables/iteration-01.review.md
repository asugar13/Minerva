# Timetable Generator/Team 22

## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

When: Thursday, February 9, 2017. 1-2 pm.
Where: Bahen Center. 40 St. George St, Toronto ON, M5S 2E4. Room 2185.

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

1. Decision to use trello. This decision was successful because it provided us with a fast and easy platform to organize and coordinate
our efforts. Specifically, it allowed us to know which tasks are unfinished, who is working on any given task and notifies the rest of
the group when a certain task is finished.

2. Decision to use slack. This decision was successful because it provided real time updates on the trello page, quick updates on team
members, focus boards for certain aspects of the project. Slack, being a desktop, browser and mobile makes it immensely convenient for
portability.

3. Decision to use Discord. This decision was successful because it provided a platform to organize an online meeting by using voice
channels.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped
         
1. Unable to decide on which front end to implement for our application. We are not sure which interface suits our application the most.At present, We are debating a choice between a desktop application and a web application. 

2. Another decision that did not work out as planned was our choice to use video conferencing to conduct our first planning meeting. All of us were not able to connect to the call, and for those of us who did connect to the call, got disconnected within the first minute. Here is a screenshot of our conversation that happened concurrently.

#### Planned changes

* We decided to opt out of the mobile application option from our front-end possibilities as users preferred using a desktop for scheduling courses.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

1. We figured we need to concretely define an API so that the backend and the frontend can be worked on simultaneously however it should be defined in a way that is agnostic to the front end interface.

2. Need to decide on tools, frameworks, and languages to be used. Need to find what is comfortable with the team and works with our needs.

3. Plan and Design the architecture of the product and decide how to delegate the tasks. If everybody turns out to be confortable with the whole system then tasks can be delegated at will otherwise higher level parts and roles should be defined and assigned.
