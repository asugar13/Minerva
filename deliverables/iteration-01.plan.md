#### Events

 * We will have weekly sync meetings during tutorials 
 * We will discuss:
* What we’ve done
* What we’re going to do/What needs to be done
* Any problems or issues we’re facing

#### Artifacts

* We will set up a task board on Trello to keep track of what needs to be done.
* Tasks will be prioritized based on the order they listed in. High priority goes to the top of the list and team members can rearrange tasks as they see fit.
* Team members take whatever tasks they are most comfortable with and move them to the assigned/working on list.
* Trello is integrated with Slack to provide notifications for updates to the board
* We will use Slack to communicate throughout the week when we run into issues
* If issues come up then process can vary slightly, for example if one feature is blocking somebody’s, then they can request for somebody to pick up that ticket or to pick it up themselves and finish it asap
