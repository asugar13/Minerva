## **Welcome!** This is *team 22*

### Instructions on how to run the Webapp

- Go to the git repository directory using the command line

- CD to the webApp directory: cd webApp

- To run the node code: node src/server
 (if you haven’t installed the node modules, the app won’t run, in that case type **npm install** before running the webApp to install the dependencies)

- Open your browser and search: localhost:3000

 Now, we need to run the JAVA server to make sure the node app gets all the relevant data (UofT courses dataset, filtered timetables…)
 
- Run the server in the JAVA app by running the main method in RestServer.java

- Input your course selection and let us show you what your schedule possibilities are!
